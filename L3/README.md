Create a base class Employee that includes:

A protected property name (employee's name).
A protected property baseSalary (fixed base salary).
An open function calculateSalary() that returns the base salary.
Create two subclasses that inherit from Employee:

FullTimeEmployee: Has an additional bonus that is added to the base salary.
PartTimeEmployee: Earns based on hourly rate and hours worked, which are used in the salary calculation.
Use mapOf to store multiple employees and their salary calculations.

Loop through the map and display each employee’s salary.
